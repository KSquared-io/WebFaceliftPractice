    <p class="centerMe">Leaving behind their close-knit community in Montepertuso of Positano, Italy, Michele 
    Mandara, along with his family, ventured to the United States in hopes of a better life.  
    Together with his sons, Augusto ‘Augie’ and Antonino ‘Tony,’ they laid the foundation for 
    Villa Monte Pizzeria and Restaurant, the true meaning of their home away from home.  After 
    successfully establishing their first location on Richmond Avenue, Villa Monte has expanded 
    itself to most of Staten Island with its other three locations.  Whether behind the counter, 
    making pizza, greeting customers, serving a glass of wine, or answering the phones for one of 
    the hundreds of deliveries a day, you will always find Chef-Owner Augie at their ‘home base’ 
    Richmond Avenue location with a welcoming smile on his face.  As the Italian saying goes, 
    Mangia Bene, Beve Bene, Si Sente Bene, Villa Monte prides itself on you entering as guests, 
    staying as friends, and leaving as family – all as you Eat Well, Drink Well, and Feel Well!</p>
