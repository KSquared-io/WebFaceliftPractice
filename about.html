            With a staff and a menu that aims to please every single customer, it’s no surprise that Villa Monte
            has become a landmark here on Staten Island and, in some cases, a household name. Whenever we have the
            pleasure of eating at Villa Monte Pizzeria, we know we will be leaving with a smile.

            Villa Monte Pizzeria & Restaurant has been an Italian Foodie Find for more than 30 years. Chef-owner,
            Augusto ‘Augie’ Mandara and his brother Antonio have been providing residents and passers through of Staten
            Island with Pizza and Italian dishes that are nothing short of delicious since 1980. Arguably one of the best
            slices of pizza on the Island can be found here along with some of the more creative style pies that can’t go
            ignored such as their mouth-watering Pesto pie, or their Fresh Mozzarella and diced Tomato square pie. Even
            their Ricotta pie has a certain something that separates it from the rest.

        <p class="centerMe">
            Their specialty salads are served in very large portions, our favorite happens to be the Arugula with red
            onions and Grilled Chicken served with a home made lemon dressing. Their broccoli-rabe tastes like it came
            right out of Grandma’s kitchen, their Chicken Marsala or their Chicken Alla Fresco are just two of the many
            popular favorites you’ll find on their menu.
        </p>
        <p class="centerMe">
            Open 7 days a week, from 11am to 11pm, they deliver to almost every inch of the Island thanks to their 4
            locations. Pricing is very fair even though they use top quality raw materials. Service is always top-notch
            and if you go to their flagship store on Richmond Avenue in the Best Buy shopping center, you’ll see Augie,
            6 days a week, either behind the counter, making pizza, greeting customers, serving a glass of wine behind
            the bar or answering the phones for one of his hundreds of deliveries a day. If that’s not a man dedicated
            to his craft, then we don’t know what is.
